# Notes Application

The Notes Application is a web-based application that allows users to create, manage, and organize their personal notes in a convenient and efficient manner. This application utilizes various technologies to provide a seamless user experience.

## Technologies Used

- Firebase Authentication: We have integrated Firebase Authentication to handle user registration, login, and authentication. Users can log in using their Google account, which provides a secure and streamlined login process.
- Firebase Firestore: We have utilized Firebase Firestore, a NoSQL cloud database, to store and manage the notes created by users. It provides real-time synchronization, scalability, and efficient querying capabilities for managing notes.
- IndexedDB: To enhance performance and reduce dependency on constant network requests, we have implemented IndexedDB as a local cache. This allows the application to store and retrieve notes locally, providing offline access and faster retrieval of data.
- Tailwind CSS: We have employed Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework, for efficient and responsive styling of the application. Tailwind CSS provides a wide range of pre-built classes that allow us to rapidly design and customize the user interface.

## Features

- Google Popup Login: Users can log in to the application using their Google account, providing a secure and convenient authentication method.
- Note Creation: Users can create new notes by entering the title and content of the note. The application saves the notes in Firebase Firestore for easy retrieval and management.
- Note Display: The application displays the list of notes created by the user. Each note is shown with its title, content, and creation date.
- Note Deletion: Users can delete unwanted notes with a single click, allowing for efficient note management.
- Note Sorting: Notes can be sorted based on their creation date, enabling users to organize their notes chronologically.
- Future Status of Notes: In the future, we plan to implement a feature that allows users to set the status of their notes, such as "in progress," "completed," or "pending." This will provide better tracking and management of notes.
- Note Update: We plan to incorporate an update feature that allows users to modify the content and details of their existing notes.
- Search Notes: A search functionality will be implemented to enable users to search for specific notes based on keywords or other criteria.
- Responsive Design: The application is designed to be responsive and adaptable to different screen sizes, providing a seamless user experience across desktop and mobile devices.
